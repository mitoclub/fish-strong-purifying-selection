VCL(curvilinear velocity, mkm) - the actual speed of movement of the sperm along its trajectory. Curved speed.

VSL(straight-line velocity, mkm) - the speed of movement of the sperm from the point of detection to the point 
of finding it at the end of the analysis. The speed of movement in a straight line.

VAP(average path velocity, mm/sec) - the average speed of the sperm head along the averaged trajectory of the 
sperm movement.

ALH(amplitude of lateral head displacement, mkm) - the amplitude of the lateral displacement of the sperm head 
from its average trajectory of movement.

BCF(beat-cross frequency, Hz) - "head beat frequency". The frequency of intersections of the sperm head of its 
average trajectory per unit of time.

LIN(linearity, %) - VSL/VCL, linearity of the trajectory. The magnitude of the oscillation of the true trajectory 
relative to the average trajectory.

STR(straightness) - VSL/VAP, linearity of the averaged trajectory. Useful movement.

WOB(wobble) - VAP/VCL, the degree of deviation of the actual trajectory relative to the average one.

MAD(mean angular displacement) - the rate of change of the actual trajectory of movement.
